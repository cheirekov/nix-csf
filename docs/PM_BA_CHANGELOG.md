# PM/BA Changelog

## 2026-02-19 — Batch KICKOFF-001

- Ticket(s): `T-000`, `T-001`
- Summary:
  - bootstrapped repository structure for a reusable NixOS firewall module,
  - implemented `services.nixCsf` baseline module,
  - added runtime apply/refresh workflow for nftables,
  - added team/process docs and delivery board.
- BA requirement mapping:
  - flake and non-flake module support,
  - CSF-inspired modern feature direction, especially country blocking.
- PM milestone mapping:
  - Phase 0 complete (`docs/ROADMAP.md`).
- Risk impact:
  - `low` (new module; no impact unless explicitly enabled by user).
- Validation evidence:
  - module evaluation and repository structure checks (local).
- Open follow-ups:
  - add formal test lane (`T-002`),
  - harden country policy modes (`T-003`).
